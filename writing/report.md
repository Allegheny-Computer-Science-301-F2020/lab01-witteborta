### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - Should Consumers Be Able to Sell Their Own Personal Data?

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Tonetti, Christopher, and Cameron F Kerry. “Should Consumers Be Able to Sell Their Own Personal Data?” The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones &amp; Company, 13 Oct. 2019, 9:00 am ET, www.wsj.com/articles/should-consumers-be-able-to-sell-their-own-personal-data-11570971600.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article is about two viewpoints on the discussion about whether consumers should be able to sell their own personal data. A professor at Stanford, Christopher Tonetti, says that consumers should be able to sell their own data and that society should encourage it. He says that ownership would give people control of their own privacy but the selling of their data would give them the decision on who uses it and how they use it. Not only this, but he emphasizes the idea that consumers will be able to profit off of their own data and that it will also promote people to use it as well. On the other hand, Cameron Kerry, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, opposes the idea of consumers selling their own data. His argument is that people might be more willing to give away a lot more of their privacy, most of which they don't understand the depth of, in return for little benefits. He also argues that our society is set up in a way that functions with constant incoming data. The logistics of completely reworking our system would be too complex and wouldn't be able to accommodate the change that consumers want now regarding their privacy.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern is whether consumers should be able to own and sell their own data.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data  that consumers own and share with a functioning society and system.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 -  From the first analysis (Tonetti's standpoint) the author believes that it is more ethical to allow consumers to own and sell their own data with the repercussion that firms, businesses, and our society's way of functioning will have to adjust with the additive of competition. The second analysis (Kerry's standpoint) expresses that it is unethical for companies to buy and sell consumers data without them knowing what's actually happening to it, selling their own data is not the solution. It is more ethical to enforce individual rights to access the data and be able to delete it rather than sacrifice the functioning and serviceable society that we have created.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - In the first analysis, companies, businesses, the government, essentially anyone who has been using data freely and indefinitely to operate will have a lot to lose and have to create new ways of functioning to stay afloat. In this same analysis, the  consumers will have a lot to gain; this privacy and money. The other analysis is essentially the opposite of this one.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - Cellphone tracking could help stem the spread of coronavirus. Is privacy the price?

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Servick, Kelly. “Cellphone Tracking Could Help Stem the Spread of Coronavirus. Is Privacy the Price?” Science, 22 Mar. 2020, 1:30 PM, www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/cellphone-tracking-could-help-stem-spread-coronavirus-privacy-price.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article addresses whether people should be willing to give up their data and privacy to help stop the spread of the Coronavirus. This data would ultimately be used for instantaneous digital contact tracing through either an app or already used or bought data from companies.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern is giving up your privacy for the health of yourself and others.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is normally used by businesses, the government, etc. will soon be used by health officials and other personal to inform you if you have been in contact with  someone who tested positive for the virus.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The public should consider if they value their health and the health of their loved ones more than they value their privacy.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The general public stands to gain knowledge and a peace of mind from knowing sooner rather than later if they have been in contact with someone who tested positive. On the other hand, individuals will lose their privacy by giving up their own data for tracking.
